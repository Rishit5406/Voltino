# VOLTINO ‚Äì Arduino UNO Rev 3 Inspired Custom Board

**VOLTINO** is a custom-designed, open-source hardware development board inspired by the Arduino‚Ñ¢ UNO Rev 3. This project refines the original design based on **Atmel's electrical recommendations** for better current and voltage control, optimized trace routing, and mechanical reliability.

Designed in **Altium Designer**, VOLTINO preserves the standard Arduino UNO pinout while offering a clean layout and professional fabrication-ready output.
